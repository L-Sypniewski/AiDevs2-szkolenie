You are navigating a 2D grid maze, starting at (0,0) and moving toward (5,0). The maze contains obstacles at coordinates [(1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2)]. Follow the instructions below to navigate to the finish point:

- The bottom-left corner of the grid is (0,0).
- The grid size is 4x6
- Allowed moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.
- After each move, provide reasoning for why the step is correct, specifically detailing how it avoids obstacles and moves closer to the finish point at (5,0).

### Instructions
1. Begin at the start point (0,0).
2. Generate each move sequentially, providing reasoning after each step.
   - **Tie each reason to the specific constraints:** Ensure that each move respects grid boundaries, avoids obstacles, and progresses toward the finish point.
   - For each move, explain why this path is optimal or necessary for avoiding obstacles.
3. Continue moving until you reach the finish point (5,0).
4. **Once you reach the finish, no further moves are needed.** Provide the final output only once the finish point is reached.

### Expected Output Format
For each step, provide reasoning in the following format:
```
- reasoning for first step
- reasoning for second step ...
- reasoning for last step <RESULT>
<RESULT>
{
 "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT"
}
</RESULT>
```


### Examples of reasoning
   - "I'm in point (0,0), so the only possible potential moves are RIGHT (to 1,0) or UP (to 0,1). There is an obstacle on (1,0) so I can move only UP". Move to make: UP to (0,1)
   - "I'm in point (0,3). Since grid size is 4x6 I cannot move UP or LEFT. The only possible moves are DOWN (0,2) or RIGHT (1,3). There is an obstacle at (1,3) to the only possible move is DOWN. Move to make: DOWN to (0,2)****


Continue this pattern until the finish point is reached, providing the final result in the specified format.
